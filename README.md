# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this project is to find how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### I started by analyzing Launch outcomes by launch date. I measured the amount of successful, failed, and canceled launches vs their launch date by month.

### Secondly, i wanted to see the outcomes vs the goals. I did this by measuring the success rate vs the dollar amount of goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- Challenges faced in this project were, where to get the Data, how to refine and present it.
- The data was taken from Gofundme. it was broken down into many categories to finaly present it in 2 categories: Outcomes vs launch date & outcomes vs Goals

## Results

- Two conclusions I can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date are:
- 1. The best time to Launch is May & June. May being the absolute best month to launch.
- 2. The riskiest/worst time to launch is in Demcember.  

- Conclusions about the Outcomes based on Goals:
- The most successful launches ask for less than $5,000.  Generally, the more money you seek, the less likely you will obtain your goal. There is however a "sweet spot" of success between $35,000-$45,000.  This could be only due to the fact that there is a limited sample size for this amount being asked.  

- Limitations of this dataset:
- amount of Goals between $35,000-$45,000

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- Another Table or Graph that might be helpful would be to go even further and break down the Goal amounts by month.  Especially May/June vs December.
